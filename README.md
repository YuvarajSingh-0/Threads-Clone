## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Fullstack Framework mostly tried to write code to render server side
- **Clerk.js**: A complete user management solution that provides all the necessary UI and backend to handle user authentication. Communities in the application is also made easy with clerkJS
- **MongoDB**: NOSQL Database of users and threads schemas defined in this [folder](https://github.com/YuvarajSingh-0/Threads-Clone/tree/master/lib/models) and the below is a depiction of Schemas using ER Model for better understanding. Although its not a relational database.
